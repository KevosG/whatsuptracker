# whatsuptracker
A tiny little app to keep you accountable while you work.  

It will prompt you every X minutes to explain what you have been doing, and runs for Y hours.

By default it will prompt every 20 minutes to account for your last 20 minutes and it will do this for 2 hours.

Personally, I work really well this way, because I feel the need to get something "juicy" done so I have something good to enter in my next prompt!
